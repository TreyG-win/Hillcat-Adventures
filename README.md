# Hillcat-Adventures
This is a project that I had a heavy amount of involvement with on a team of 6 of us! I was involved with the gameplay mechanics and back-end development overall. I had a smaller hand in modeling a number of the assets that appear in the game.

These are the functions that I have developed within this project:
  * Dialogue system, this includes the ability to transition the camera to focus on a particular character if desired.
  * Scoring managers for the minigames as well as the ability to track the score on the main scene.
  * Objective manager, including being able to toggle the visible of objectives.
  * Exhaustion system with a UI element on screen, implemented the ability to lose/heal exhaustion.
  * Transitions between scenes, such as moving between minigames or the prologue/epilogue screen.
  * Ability to interact with the world (doors, NPCs, minigame triggers, etc.) as well as created the UI elements to prompt when the player can interact with these objects.
  * The drone minigame's introduction screen and the arena to fly in.
  * Adjusted the UI elements to smoothly function on a 1920x1080 monitor.

As a part of handling this project's programming side, I have coordinated a number of design choices with other teammates creating various UI elements such as:
  * Dialogue system's UI elements
  * Objective system's UI elements
  * Computer UI to display minigame scores
